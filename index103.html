          <b><dt>1. CUT CALORIES</dt></b>
          <br>
          <dd>-The more calories you consume the more weight you you put in especially with little to no physical activity <br> 
               However, by cutting calories and doubling up on exercise the more weight you will shed.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <b><dt>2. CUT CARBS</dt></b>
          <br>
          <dd>-Reducing carbs tends to reduce your appetite and cause automatic weight loss, or weight loss without the need to count calories. <br>
             For some people, a low carb diet allows them to eat until fullness, feel satisfied, and still lose weight</dd>

        <br>
        
        <b><dt>3. DRINK MORE WATER</dt></b>
        <br>
        <dd>-By drinking more water, you support normal kidney function, which increases the amount of urine that passes through your kidneys and <br>
           flushes toxins from your body.Boosting you water intake also helps prevent the buildup of minerals that can cause kidney stones.</dd>
      
        <br>

        <b><dt>4. BY EXERCISING DAILY</dt></b>
        
        <br>
        <dd>-Exercise helps people lose weight and lower the risk of some diseases. Exercising regularly lowers a person's risk of developing some diseases, <br>
           including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Exercise also can help keep your body at a healthy weight. Exercise can help a person age well. </dd>

    1.Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Extend both arms out straight to your sides to form a T with your body. <br>
          <br>
    2.Slowly rotate your shoulders and arms to make forward circles about 1 foot in diameter. <br>
             <br>
   3. Continue for 15 circles, then reverse directions and complete 15 rotations in the opposite direction. <br>
   <br>

    2. Shift your pelvis and bottom forward so there’s a 3- to 6-inch gap between your back and <br>
       the object — giving you clearance as you dip down. <br>
       <br>
    3. Bend your legs in a 90-degree angle with your feet planted firmly on the ground, or exten <br> 
      them out in front of you (but don’t lock your knees). <br>

  <p style="font-size:1.5vw;">
    Hi I'm Charlie. Ever since I started playing sports at 5 years old, fitness has been an integral part of my life, all thanks to the motivation from family and coaches   <br>
    I want to be that same motivation for others, and help form a lifelong habit. I love to help others reach their full potential, being that voice that says <br> 
    “I can do one more”. I believe that building a strong foundation of proper technique, followed by consistency and progression, will allow you to achieve any fitness goal you set your mind to. <br>
